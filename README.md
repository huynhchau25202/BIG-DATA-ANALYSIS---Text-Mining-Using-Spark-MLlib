# BIG DATA ANALYSIS - Text Mining with Spark MLlib

## 📌 Introduction

This project focuses on **Big Data Analytics and Text Mining** using **Apache Spark MLlib**. The project applies machine learning techniques to extract insights from large-scale text data, enabling sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and classification.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- **Apache Spark MLlib**: A scalable machine learning library for big data processing.

- **Python (PySpark)**: An interface for running Spark applications.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for experimentation and visualization.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec and N-gram.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression and Random Forest for text classification.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identify positive, negative and neutral sentiments from text data.

- **Topic Modeling**: Use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to extract meaningful topics.

## 📊 Visualization

The processed data and analysis results can be visualized using:

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For graphical representation of text analysis.
